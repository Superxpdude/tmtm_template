// If a "group" is set during the mission, respawn loadouts will be pulled from that group instead of the base XPTLoadouts.hpp file *if present*.
// Loadout definition is the same as XPTLoadouts. Examples are located in XPTLoadouts.hpp
// Loadout groups can be set by running the following code on the server
// ["newLoadoutGroup"] call XPT_fnc_setLoadoutGroup
